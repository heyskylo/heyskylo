/*
 * rish.h — stable C ABI of the rish pure-Rust, JIT-less x86-64 interpreter.
 *
 * Vendored from https://github.com/ZSeven-W/rish (platform/rish.h), pinned at
 * commit 9020e9648115bd9ae8eb5215dd3e7ac76620da3f. rish is MIT-licensed.
 *
 * The ROM host (main) calls rish_vm_boot_session / rish_vm_session_exec_json
 * to boot a real x86-64 Linux kernel and run commands inside the guest with no
 * JIT and no guest privilege on the host.

/**
 * Trusted-host registry fetch callback used by rish_pull_image_json.
 *
 * request_json is a bounded, versioned JSON envelope and is borrowed only for
 * the duration of this call. body_fd is a borrowed writable file descriptor:
 * the callback must not close it or retain it after returning. Stream response
 * bytes into body_fd incrementally and stop at request.max_response_bytes;
 * never encode a manifest, config, or layer body into response_meta_json.
 *
 * response_meta_json receives a versioned JSON envelope:
 * {"protocol_version":1,"ok":true,"status":200,
 *  "headers":{"content-type":["application/octet-stream"]},
 *  "error":null,"retryable":false}
 *
 * Set response_meta_len to the exact number of bytes written, without a NUL
 * terminator. Return zero when the callback itself completed; network failures
 * are represented with ok=false. A non-zero return is treated as a host bridge
 * failure. The callback must enforce HTTPS/redirect/auth policy and must not
 * forward Authorization across origins.
